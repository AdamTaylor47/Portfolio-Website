                    <p>
                        I thrive on solving problems through creative, user-friendly applications. Outside of troubleshooting, you can often find me immersed in video games or enjoying a round of golf.

                        I enjoy working on creative and visually engaging aspects of development. Itâ€™s exciting to design interfaces and bring ideas to life in a way that users can interact with and enjoy. Object orientated and front-end development are my favorites.

                        While not my primary focus, I appreciate the problem-solving challenges of backend and technical work. It's rewarding to ensure everything functions smoothly behind the scenes.
